abstract = {Search-based procedural content generation methods allow video games to introduce new content continually, thereby engaging the player for a longer time while reducing the burden on developers. However, games so far have not explored the potential economic value of unique evolved artifacts. Building on this insight, this paper presents for the first time a Facebook game called Petalz in which players can share flowers they breed themselves with other players through a global marketplace. In particular, the market in this social game allows players to set the price of their evolved aesthetically-pleasing flowers in virtual currency. Furthermore, the transaction in which one player buys seeds from another creates a new social element that links the players in the transaction. The combination of unique user-generated content and social gaming in Petalz facilitates meaningful collaboration between users, positively influences the dynamics of the game, and opens new possibilities in digital entertainment.},

Levels are created using a grammar-based method: first generating rhythms, then generating geometry based on those rhythms. Generation is constrained by a set of style parameters tweakable by a human designer. The approach also minimizes the amount of content that must be manually authored, instead relying on geometry components that are included in the level designer's tileset and a set of jump types. Our results show that this method produces an impressive variety of levels, all of which are fully playable.},

The agent has been developed in the context of a joint project between the University of Calabria (UniCal) and the Vienna University of Technology (TU Vienna). The specific issues that arise when introducing artificial intelligence in a physics-based game are dealt with a combination of traditional imperative programming and declarative programming , used for modeling discrete knowledge about the game and the current situation. In particular, we make use of HEX programs , which are an extension of answer set programming (ASP) programs toward integration of external computation sources, such as 2-D physics simulation tools.

@article{Renz2016,

The goal of the competition is to build AI agents that can play new Angry Birds levels as good as or better than the best human players. Successful agents should be able to quickly analyze new levels and to predict physical consequences of possible actions in order to select actions that solve a given level with a high score. Agents have no access to the game internal physics, but only receive screenshots of the live game. In this paper we describe why this problem is a challenge for AI, and why it is an important step towards building AI that can successfully interact with the real world. We also summarise some highlights of past competitions, including a new competition track we introduced recently.},

abstract = {This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) for the procedural generation of levels in the Angry Birds game. The GA evaluates the levels based on a simulation which measures the elements' movement during a period of time. The algorithm's objective is to minimize this metric to generate stable structures. The level evaluation also considers some restrictions, leading the levels to have certain characteristics. Since there is no open source code of the game, a game clone has been developed independently of our algorithm. This implementation can be used to support experiments with procedural content generation (PCG) methods for this game type. We performed experiments in order to evaluate the expressivity of the level generator and the results showed that the proposed algorithm could generate levels with interesting stable structures.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the second AIBIRDS level generation competition, held jointly at the 2017 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games, and the 26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. This competition tasked entrants with developing a level generator for the physics-based puzzle game Angry Birds. Submitted generators were required to deal with many physical reasoning constraints caused by the realistic nature of the game's environment, in addition to ensuring that the created levels were fun, challenging and solvable. This year's competition was a significant improvement over the previous year, with a greater number of participants and more advanced generators. Within this paper we describe the framework, rules, submitted generators and results for this competition. We also provide some background information on related research and other video game AI competitions, as well as discussing what can be learned from this year's competition. There are several game and real-world applications for this type of research, and we provide some examples of the types of levels we would like future competition entries to generate.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe our design of a generator for automatically generating fun levels in the famous game Angry Birds and its clone games. In particular, we aim at generation of character-sequence levels. In order to generate fun levels, we propose a pattern-struct approach and a preset-model approach. The pattern-struct approach generates each time different appearance for one of the alphabetical letters, numeral numbers, or some symbols. The preset-model approach is used for increasing the legibility and diversity, where models are built in advance for some capital letters and numbers. Our level generator, called Funny Quotes, was the winner of the Fun Track of the CIG 2016 Level Generation Competition held in 2016 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games. After raising issues residing in Funny Quotes through user-evaluation results in terms of legibility of characters in generated levels and of playability of those levels, we propose and evaluate new mechanisms for ensuring the disparity in difficulty among easy, normal, and hard levels for the 2017 competition.},

It processes each gene independently and requires less memory than the simple GA. The development of the compact GA is guided by a proper understanding of the role of the GA's parameters and operators. The paper clearly illustrates the mapping of the simple GA's parameters into those of an equivalent compact GA. Computer simulations compare both algorithms in terms of solution quality and speed. Finally, this work raises important questions about the use of information in a genetic algorithm, and its ramifications show us a direction that can lead to the design of more efficient GA's.
